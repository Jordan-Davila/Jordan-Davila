### Skills

I'm familiar with most current industry tooling and framework choices such as _Laravel_, _Vue_, _React_, _Tailwind_, _RestAPI_, and the great majority of _HTML_ and _CSS_ pre/post-processors. I'm also an advocate for readable, clean code and show it through my constant efforts of standardizing coding styles and knowledge sharing.

My peers usually think I'm easy-going, communicative, a fast learner, and a reference for CSS and JavaScript knowledge. To top it off, I'm also familiar with cybersecurity and the wide variety of pentesting tools such as _NMap_, _BurpSuite_, _Metasploit_, _SQLMap_, _GoBuster_ and more.
